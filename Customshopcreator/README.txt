This is a script that allows you to place a store wherever you wish using customizable coords within the config.lua
this is a working progress and allows you to sell and list custom items at the shop and move it anywhere that you wish
along with a green marker from where you sell the items configured! please feel free to edit and progress this script further 
with added features and do keep me updated as i would love to see this script go further in development as i dont have much time right now
YOU WILL NEED A LITTLE BIT OF EXPERIENCE GETTING THE SHOP SET UP WITH YOUR PRODUCTS BUT ITS NOT HARD ONCE YOU KNOW!
